# Outlier-ML
Demo scripts for machine learning outlier detection methods using scikit-learn.

Demo scripts are provided for outlier and anomaly detection using the following methods:
- [Isolation Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html)
- [One-Class Support Vector Machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html)
- [Local Outlier Factor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.html)

## Dependancies
*  python
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)

## Usage
Each file is meant to be run as a script, either in Spyder or using the following commands:
```python
python IsolationForest.py
python LocalOutlierFactor.py
python OneclassSVM.py
```

These will produce console outputs and plots. 
Howwever, using an IDE with a workspace like Spyder is ideal, 
because following the comments and running the code line by line
will allow you derive the most benefit from the way these demos
are structured!
